# NearMissSnake

Unorthodox snake game where you need to push apple into snakes mouth using solid blocks or your tail.
Project uses my favorite game mechanic - color palette swap. Here it happens on death with nice interpolation to next random chosen color palette.
For colored rectangles, text and sound used [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) framework.
